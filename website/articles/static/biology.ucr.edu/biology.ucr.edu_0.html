<h2>The Natural Reserve System at UC Riverside</h2>
<p>

The University of California maintains more than thirty Natural Reserves 
distributed throughout the state.  The establishment of the 
<a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/">system-wide UC Natural Reserve System</a> was 
due in large part to the efforts in the 1940s and 1950s of Professors Ken 
Norris of UCLA and UC Santa Cruz and Wilbur Mayhew of UC Riverside, along with 
many others, who became concerned with the ever-increasing vandalism and 
disappearance of their field sites for research and teaching.  Originally called 
the "Natural Land and Water Resources System," the Natural Reserve System was 
formally approved by the UC Regents in 1965.  In essence, it is a 'library' of 
field sites.  The system encompasses a wide variety of habitats, and is intended 
to insure that teachers and researchers will continue to have access to 
undisturbed natural habitats into the future.

<p>

Through the Biology Department, UC Riverside administers four major reserves 
that have research facilities and permanent staff; these are the 
<b><a href="#DCYN">Deep Canyon</a>, <a href="#GMR">Granite Mountains</a>, 
<a href="#Motte">Motte</a></b>, and <b><a href="#James">James</a></b> Reserves. 
Another four minor reserves are also part of the UCR reserve network. Together 
they form a considerable portion of the University's total Natural Reserve System. 
Within the nearly 11,400 hectares (28,000 acres) included in the UC 
Riverside-managed reserves is a broad representation of Southern California's 
flora, fauna, and major ecosystems. These lands are an invaluable outdoor 
laboratory for teaching and research, used by scientists throughout the world. 
In addition, many endangered or diminishing species are protected from the 
urbanization occurring in Southern California on "habitat islands" preserved 
within reserve boundaries.

<h2>The Phillip L. Boyd Deep Canyon Desert Research Center</h2>
<p>

Boyd Deep Canyon is located near Palm Desert, in Riverside County.  It 
encompasses a large transect of largely desert habitats ranging from the 
extremely arid Colorado Desert environment in the Coachella Valley at sea level 
through scrubland and pinon-juniper woodlands to montane forest on the crest of 
the Santa Rosa Mountains (2,650 meters elevation).  Biodiversity within the 
reserve is correspondingly rich, and the steep-walled canyon contains a 
semipermanent stream and spectacular topography.  Deep Canyon is the only 
protected site in the Colorado Desert dedicated to biological research and 
teaching.  Scientific studies at Deep Canyon date to 1956, and since the 
mid-1970s the physiological ecology, environmental physiology, behavior, and 
conservation biology of desert organisms have been predominant research themes.  
The Reserve also protects more than 50 archaeological sites.  Click

Systemwide home page for Deep Canyon.

<h2>The James San Jacinto Mountains Reserve</h2>
<p>

The James Reserve is a small piece of UC-owned land in the San Jacinto Mountains 
that abuts a large area of protected National Forest lands in the Hall Canyon 
Research Natural Area.  It is located near the small community of Idyllwild at 
an elevation of about 2,200 meters.  The San Jacinto Mountains are home to a 
mixture of plants characteristic of many different regions, including the Sierra 
Nevada, Baja California, the coast, and the desert, as well as a number of 
endemic species.  Research at the James Reserve is comparably diverse and 
encompassed by extremes in scale, from the population biology of Drosophila to 
use of space shuttle photography and other remote sensing technologies to 
analyze local and regional biodiversity and the dynamics of community structure.  
Click <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/james/james_san_jacinto.htm">here</a> to go to the 
Reserve's Systemwide home page.  You can also check out the 
<a href="http://www.jamesreserve.edu/">James Reserve's "own" home page</a>.

<p>
<b>The Oasis de los Osos Reserve</b>, located at the west end of the Coachella 
Valley, is managed in association with the James Reserve.  The reserve is sited 
on a steep elevational gradient near the base of the north-facing escarpment of 
Mount San Jacinto.  A perennial stream, Lambs Creek, runs through Oasis de los 
Osos, supporting one of the very few riparian woodlands in the Colorado Desert.  
The Reserve contains numerous archaeological resources from the Cahuilla people, 
including rock art, middens, and shelters.<br>

<h2>The Motte Rimrock Reserve</h2>
<p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>
The Motte Reserve contains large areas of open grassland, coastal sage scrub, willow riparian woodland, and rocky outcrops atop a 
rolling plateau near the town of Perris. As the surrounding area experiences rapid urbanization the Reserve serves to protect a 
number of species threatened or endangered by development and habitat loss, such as the Stephen's kangaroo rat, California 
gnatcatcher (both shown at right), orange-throated whiptail, and Bell's sage sparrow, as well as several diminishing plant 
communities such as Riversidian sage scrub. The Motte Reserve also possesses a rich archaeological history, including some of 
the best-preserved pictographs in Southern California. <p>

The Motte Reserve is frequently used for teaching because of its convenient location, about 20 minutes from the UCR campus. 
Click <a href="http://nrs.ucop.edu/reserves/motte/motte_rimrock.htm">here</a>  to go to the Systemwide home page for the Motte Reserve.  
<p>    <p>
The <b>Box Springs Reserve</b>, located in the rugged granite hills directly above the UCR campus, is also managed through the Motte 
Reserve.  Box Springs is in a transition zone between coastal sage scrub and chamise chaparral and despite its close proximity to campus 
contains at least two threatened or endangered species. <p>

<h2>The Emerson Oaks Reserve</h2>

Situated in southwestern Riverside County, the Emerson Oaks Reserve lies at the convergence of four climatic influences--desert, 
coastal, interior, and mountain.  E-Oaks supports unique, spring-fed habitats that include rare century-old southern oak woodlands, 
chaparral, and Riversidian sage scrub. Although a comprehensive inventory is progress, Emerson contains a number of declining species.  
A newly renovated lab building offers space for research and educational activities.<p>

<h2>The Jack and Marilyn Sweeney Granite Mountains Desert Research Center</h2>
<p>The rugged and scenic Granite Mountains are located in eastern San Bernardino 
County at the convergence of three North American deserts: Mojave, Sonoran and 
Great Basin. The 9000 acre Research Center is within the boundaries of the 
Mojave National Preserve. The Center contains spectacularly varied topography 
and habitats ranging from creosote desert plains and alluvial fans (about 1200 m 
elevation), cactus and Joshua tree scrublands, extending up into extensive 
pinon-juniper woodlands at higher elevations (to 2400 m). The site is of 
outstanding biological and anthropological interest, with a particularly rich 
flora and fauna. In addition, the Reserve is close to other critical Mojave 
Desert habitats, including riparian areas, Joshua tree forests at Cima Dome, 
native bunchgrass prairie and Great Basin sagebrush in the Midhills, several 
dry lake basins, and the extensive sand dunes near Kelso. To learn more about 
this reserve, visit the website at: <a href="http://granites.ucnrs.org">http://granites.ucnrs.org.</a>

<p>The isolated <b>Sacramento Mountains Reserve</b>, also located in the eastern 
Mojave Desert (about 29 km west of Needles), is managed in association with the 
Granite Mountains Desert Research Center. This Reserve is located on a rocky 
desert slope; the associated bench and alluvial areas contain at least seven 
species of cacti, including an exceptionally dense stand of Bigelow (teddy bear) 
cholla.
