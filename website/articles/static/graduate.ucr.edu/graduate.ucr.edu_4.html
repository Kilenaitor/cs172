<h1>Funding Opportunities at UCR</h1>
<p>UCR offers a variety of multi-year funding opportunities for incoming students that may include stipends, full or partial payment of tuition and fees, and appointment as a Teaching Assistant (TA) or Graduate Student Researcher (GSR). An applicant is judged on the basis of the quality of previous academic work, the evidence of ability to do research and other creative accomplishments, and the promise of becoming a productive scholar. A contribution to the campus goal of achieving a diverse student body may also be a consideration. Fellowship/grant awards are paid from a variety of funding sources, some of which require financial data. Students who receive fellowships, and full or partial teaching and research positions must register for and complete a full program of study and research each quarter, remain in good academic standing and make acceptable progress toward their degree.</p>
<h3>Fellowships</h3>
<p><span>All recipients of fellowships:</span></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><span>must be making acceptable progress toward their degrees (For these purposes, acceptable progress for a Ph.D. student means students must be advanced to candidacy within 12 quarters after entry and must complete the degree by the normative time to degree for the particular program plus one year. For most master's students, acceptable progress is represented by enrollment for not more than three years.);</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>must have less than 8 units of Incomplete grades;</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>must maintain a 3.00 GPA</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>must enroll in and complete a full course load (12 graduate units or the equivalent)</span></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><span>changes in degree objective and/or degree program may affect eligibility for continuation of the award.</span></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p>Fellowships are awarded to students to free them from the need for employment. Employment supplementation will be considered up to a total 10 hrs/week (25% time) during the tenure of the award and may be approved up to 50% for limited periods (usually no more than 1 quarter) but only if employment averages 25 percent or less over the course of the academic year.  Fellowship awards with less than a $10,000 stipend may be supplemented without approval of the Dean. Fellowship awards with a stipend of $10,000 or higher may be supplemented only after approval of the Graduate Dean.  The Graduate Advisor in your program must make the request of the Dean in writing. Fellowships that do not allow supplementation are the Dissertation Year Fellowships (DYFA and DYP).  The Graduate Research Mentorship Program (GRMP) allows only limited supplementation as a 25% Graduate Student Researcher appointment (GSR). </p>
<h3>Eugene Cota-Robles Award (ECRA)</h3>
<p style="margin-top: 0.1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1pt;">This four-year fellowship program, funded by the University of California Office of the President, the UCR Graduate Division, and the home department, supports a limited number of students entering PhD programs and are interested in a career in college or university teaching. The fellowship currently provides a stipend of $24,000 that supplements a financial award created by the home program. This award includes payment of tuition and non-resident supplemental tuition if necessary. Applicants must be nominated by their graduate program. Students pursuing degrees other than the PhD are not eligible for this program.</p>
<p style="margin: 0.1pt 0in 0.1pt 30px;"> </p>
<p style="margin-top: 0.1pt; margin-right: 0in; margin-bottom: 0.1pt;">Applicants must be either U.S. citizens or permanent residents, must be academically meritorious and should demonstrate high potential and promise. Individuals from cultural, racial, linguistic, geographic and socioeconomic backgrounds that are currently underrepresented in graduate education are especially encouraged to participate in the program. The intent of this fellowship is to provide access to higher education for students who might otherwise find it difficult or impossible to successfully pursue graduate study. Applicants must complete the Supplemental Fellowship Form included as an optional form in the UCR Graduate Application for Admission. This form will be reviewed as part of your submitted graduate application.</p>
<h3>Dissertation Research Grant</h3>
<p>provides funds to doctoral candidates for research-related expenses associated with the dissertation. Applicants must be advanced to candidacy and plan to be registered during the period of the award. Proposals may be funded up to a maximum of $1,000. </p>

For more information go to: <a href="http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html">http://chass.ucr.edu/research/student.html</a></p>
<h3>Graduate Research Mentoring Program and Dissertation Year Program Awards</h3>
<p>The Graduate Research Mentoring Program (GRMP) award is intended to enhance the mentoring of domestic PhD students entering their 3rd, 4th, or 5th years of graduate school who are actively engaged in research. The Dissertation Year Program (DYP) Award is intended for MFA or PhD students who expect to complete their degree program the year in which the award is received.  Eligible students can receive up to three quarters each of the DYP and GRMP fellowships and may reapply if they have not reached this max.</p>

<h3>Digital Research Methods Fellowship</h3>
<p>GradQuant is dedicated to expanding its support for graduate student in the humanities and social sciences. In support of this goal, Graduate Division is partnering with GradQuant to offer the Digital Research Methods Fellowship in order to develop future GradQuant consultants in the area of digital and quantitative research methods for the humanities and social sciences.  The fellowship will fund students to attend the <a href="http://dhsi.org/courses.php" target="_blank" title="DHSI Courses">Digital Humanities Summer Institute</a> (DHSI) in order to 1.) enhance the student's own research methodologies and 2.) disseminate knowledge of the chosen digital method to other graduate students. DHSI takes place in June in at the University of Victoria in British Columbia.  The fellowship will include </p>
<ol>
<li>registration, travel, and accommodation for one course at the DHSI in Summer 2017</li>
<li>possibility for a 10% appointment in GradQuant (4 hours per week) during the 2017-18 academic year</li>
</ol>
<p>The successful applicant will be expected to register and attend the selected course at the DHSI, develop at least 2 but preferably 3 workshops in digital research methods for humanities and social sciences, deliver said workshops multiple times over the course of the 2017-18 academic year, and be available to serve as a part-time consultant* offering individual consultations and collaborative office hours in GradQuant during the 2017-18 academic year.</p>
<p>To apply, students must be in good academic standing, be a registered graduate student in a CHASS department, have a clear idea of how they would incorporate this research method into their own research, and expect to graduate no earlier than June 2018. Preference will be given to those with excellent teaching evaluations and whose chosen method is of particular need in the GradQuant Center.</p>
<p>Apply <a href="https://form.jotform.com/50487004486962" target="_blank" title="DRM Application">online here</a>.  Application review will begin on November 14th, but all applications submitted prior to December 1st will be reviewed. As DHSI sessions are already filling up, early application is encouraged. Applicants will need an up-to-date CV but the application does not request a letter of recommendation or personal statement.</p>
<p>*Fellowships that disallow this type of employment for one or more quarters will not prevent a student from the DRM award. The 10% appointment is not guaranteed and will be secured after a successful interview with the GradQuant Coordinator. GradQuant reserves the right to remove this part-time employment at any time. </p>
