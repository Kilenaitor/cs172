<p>The University of California, Riverside is committed to protecting the safety and security of all students, staff, and faculty, as well as visitors to our campus, and to providing accurate and complete information regarding crimes committed within the campus community. We believe that our policies and programs for preventing a</p>
<p>nd reducing crime, and our emergency notices, timely warnings and disclosure of crimes reported, promote a safer, more informed community. Please take time to read this information and, if you have questions, contact the resources identified below for assistance.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Clery Act Overview and Important Information &amp; Links</strong></em></h3>
<p>The "Jeanne CLERY Disclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act of 1998," commonly referred to as the "CLERY Act," requires institutions of higher education receiving federal financial aid to report specified crime statistics on college campuses and to provide other safety and crime information to members of the campus community.</p>
<p>The University provides crime information and statistics to the public in a variety of ways. In addition to the CLERY Act, the University provides to the California Department of Justice crime statistics that are classified pursuant to the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the FBI. These statistics are reflected in the University of California Police Department Annual Report and Crime Statistics, the annual California Department of Justice Crime in California, and the annual FBI Crime in the United States publications.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Preparation of Annual Disclosure of Crime Statistics</strong></em></h3>
<p>The current Annual Campus Security Report has been compiled for the previous calendar year <em>(2015)</em> from crime reports received by the UC Riverside Police Department; from crime statistics received from other police agencies having jurisdiction over Public Property on and around UC Riverside, off-campus UC Riverside affiliated, owned, or controlled property; from crime reports received in response to written requests sent to non-police campus security authorities; and from reports received through established reporting guidelines. The report also includes disciplinary referrals by a variety of UCR Offices that administer conduct by both students and employees for drug, alcohol and weapons and other Clery Act Crimes not otherwise reported as an arrest or crime.</p>

<h5>Campus Security Authorities - CSA's Responsible for Reporting Criminal Activity</h5>
<p>The University has designated certain administrators and staff as “Campus Security Authorities” in recognition that many students, faculty and staff may be hesitant about reporting crimes to UC Riverside Police Department (campus police), and maybe more inclined to report incidents to non-law enforcement administrators and staff instead. Another possible option is to send the UC Riverside Police Department an <em>anonymous tip</em> via <a href="/anon.html">http://police.ucr.edu/anon.html</a>.</p>
<p>The law defines “Campus Security Authority” as: “An official of an institution who has significant responsibility for student and campus activities, including, but not limited to, student housing, student discipline, and campus judicial proceedings.” An example would be a dean of students who oversees student housing, a student center, or student extra-curricular activities and has significant responsibility for student and campus activities. Similarly, a director of athletics, team coach, and faculty advisor to a student group also has significant responsibility for student and campus activities. A single teaching faculty member is unlikely to have significant responsibility for student and campus activities, except when serving as an advisor to a registered student group. Clerical staff, as well, is unlikely to have significant responsibility for student and campus activities. For more information about the Clery Act and the role of Campus Security Authorities go to <a href="/clery/clery.html">http://police.ucr.edu/clery/clery.html</a> and click “Clery Act Training” for the PowerPoint presentation.</p>
<p>Campus Security Authorities are charged with reporting to the appropriate law enforcement personnel, either UC Riverside Police Department or local police, or to any official or office which should be informed of the crime or complaint due to the nature of the crime or complaint, those allegations of Clery Act crimes that the Campus Security Authority concludes are made in good faith. A Campus Security Authority is not responsible for determining whether a crime took place as that is the function of law enforcement and its investigatory process.</p>
<p>A Campus Security Authority is required to report all allegations to law enforcement personnel, even if the Campus Security Authority was told of a crime in the context of providing emotional support or health care support. The allegations will be reported whether or not the victim chooses to file a report with law enforcement or press charges. A Campus Security Authority may also provide a victim or witness with assistance in reporting a crime to UC Riverside Police Department or local police, or to any official or office which should be informed of the crime or complaint. Third-party security guards for UCR special events are Campus Security Authorities. These responsibilities and duties are included by a contractual memorandum of understanding (MOU).</p>
<p>Pastoral counselors and mental health counselors at the University are not Campus Security Authorities, and are therefore exempt from disclosing or reporting allegations of crimes and incidents. However, to be exempt from the Clery Act reporting requirements, the counselor must be acting in their professional role of pastoral or mental health counselors at the University. For example, a Dean who has a PhD in Psychology is not acting in the counseling role, but rather as a Dean; and a PhD student in Psychology working in the counseling center as part of his/her education and training is acting in the counseling role. Pastoral counselors and mental health counselors are trained in the procedures for reporting crimes and the procedures for reporting crimes confidentially. The University encourages them to inform their clients of the procedures in accordance with their professional judgment, given the individual victim and circumstances before them. In addition, the Student Health Services employees, including the Campus CARE Advocate, ombudsperson, medical director, physicians and nurses are not Campus Security Authorities.</p>
<h5>Law Enforcement</h5>
<p>The UC Riverside Police Department at 3500 Canyon Crest Drive Riverside, Ca. 92521 operates 24 hours-per-day, 365 days a year. The non-emergency UC Riverside Police Department number is (951) 827-5222 and the Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP) for all 911 system calls originating from telephones located at UCR, meaning that responses to all 911 calls (Police/Fire/Medical emergencies) are coordinated through the UC Riverside Police Department. The department is an authorized terminal user of all local, regional, state and federal criminal justice information systems (e.g., wanted persons, DMV, stolen vehicles/property, criminal records, etc.). UC Riverside Police Department employs Police Officers and Community Service Officers (CSO's) to deliver public safety services to the campus community.</p>
<p>Our goal is to provide timely and appropriate responses to community problems and needs. Police officers of the UC Riverside Police Department are armed, duly sworn peace officers of the State of California. Empowered by section 830.2(b) of the California Penal Code, UC Riverside Police Officers possess the same authority, and adhere to the same state-mandated standards, as municipal police officers. Therefore, under California law, UC Riverside Police Officers may enforce laws and make arrests anywhere in the state; however, we concentrate our efforts on the campus and its immediate surrounding area.</p>
<p>UC Riverside Police Officers may work in uniform or plain-clothes. They provide a full range of police related services, including: primary emergency responses; preventative patrols; investigation of observed, reported, or suspected crimes; enforcement of all applicable laws; follow-up and specialized criminal investigations; crime prevention; community liaison and relations; V.I.P./dignitary protection; special event security; traffic activities (enforcement and accident investigations).</p>
<p>Persons arrested by the UC Riverside Police Officers are processed in accordance with prevailing practices in Riverside County, which can include: citation and release; booking into the Riverside County Jail; filing of charges with, and prosecution through, the District Attorney's Office; and formal trial. Additionally, UCR affiliates (student, faculty, staff) may be subject to additional (administrative/Code of Conduct) sanctions.</p>
<p>By mutual agreement with state and federal agencies, the UC Riverside Police Department maintains an NLETS terminal (National Law Enforcement Telecommunications Network). Through this system police personnel can access the National Crime Information Computer system as well as the California Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (CLETS). These computer databases are used for accessing criminal history data, nationwide police records, driver/vehicle identification information, as well as other local, state and federal law enforcement information.</p>
<p>Community Service Officers (CSO's) are student employees. They wear distinctive shirts and/or jackets, are not armed, and perform many specialized services for the community, including: contract security patrols (e.g., campus housing areas), campus building security checks/unlocks/lock-ups, and occasional campus escorts.</p>
<p>Our department enjoys a positive and close working relationship with the City of Riverside Police Department, with whom we share proximity, mutual interests, and geographic jurisdiction. Both Police Departments share information regarding crimes in each jurisdiction. Additionally, both departments participate in the University Neighborhood Enhancement Team.</p>
<p>The University Neighborhood Enhancement Team (UNET) is a cooperative effort between the UC Riverside Police Department and the Riverside Police Department. Each agency has committed four officers and one sergeant to a seventeen square mile area, which surrounds the university. Officers are encouraged to identify community concerns and seek out novel approaches to solving those concerns. There is a memorandum of understanding between the UC Riverside Police Department and the Riverside Police Department for the UNET program.</p>
<p>UNET team members work two shifts, day shift and swing shift. Officers from the UC Riverside Police Department are paired up with officers from the Riverside Police Department. This has proven crucial, as the officers can act as liaisons for the respective agency. UNET team members work primarily in full uniform and drive marked police cars. One of the most effective tools at UNET's disposal is the use of the bicycle in patrol activities. UNET regularly conducts bicycle crime abatement programs, which have resulted in numerous arrests for drug related crimes and has impacted the neighborhood with a significant decrease in overall crime activity. UNET has focused on everything from drugs and gangs, to burglaries and auto thefts during these programs.</p>
<p>UNET has been working very closely with the University Neighborhood Association (UNA). UNA is a community action group, which is comprised of residents, university students and university staff who live in the immediate area. UNET team members attend UNA Monthly meetings and bring community concerns back to the team. The team has proactively worked on the concerns of UNA and brought several issues to a close. Traffic problems and neighbor conflicts with college students renting homes in the area continue to be the association's main concerns.</p>
<p>In response to these concerns, team members have developed programs to address them head on. As a result, traffic enforcement days have resulted in numerous citations being issued, impacting many of the traffic problems presented by UNA. Team members continue to work with student groups who rent single-family residences in the area. These students often clash with residents who have lived in their neighborhoods for many years. Officers have resolved several problems through conflict resolution techniques and have acted as mediators between the students and residents. We have also used the regular party patrols and enforcement of the Riverside City Loud Party Ordinance effectively. This ordinance has decreased the number of repeat visits by law enforcement to loud party calls and helps to quickly stop the disturbances. Considerable time and effort has been spent helping the students understand how to be good neighbors.</p>
<p>UNA has been instrumental in identifying problems in the university neighborhood, and UNET continues to work closely with this organization, as their goal is to better their neighborhood.</p>
<p>Team members have been assigned to individual apartment complexes within the UNET boundaries and are working closely with those apartment's managers. Team members are assisting the managers through the Riverside Crime Free Multi Housing Program and have begun "Phase 3" inspections for the program. The apartment managers, as well as the UNET officers have been very receptive to the program and are continuing to make their complexes safe for their residents.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Reporting Crimes and Emergencies </strong></em></h3>
<p>Community members, students, faculty, staff and guests are encouraged to report all crimes and public safety related incidents to the UC Riverside Police Department in a timely manner. In general, reports are confidential unless the victim gives permission to document identifying information or for police to investigate. Report forms include crime definitions and request specific information (date, location, nature of offense). This information is used to compile statistics, while preserving confidentiality, avoiding duplicate or inaccurate statistical reporting, and to assign reports to appropriate Clery and FBI crime classifications.</p>
<p>All police/fire/medical emergencies should be reported immediately, utilizing the 911 system reporting procedure appropriate to the telephone instrument or by using the emergency call boxes located in or adjacent to parking lots.</p>
<ul>
<li>All PBX station phones (those capable of 4-digit extension interoffice calls) must dial 911.</li>
<li>All dormitory room phones dial 911.</li>
<li>On-Campus residences and businesses on outside lines (e.g., Bannockburn and Crest Housing) must dial 911.</li>
<li>All pay phones are programmed for 911 access by dialing 911 after receipt of a dial tone. No coin deposit should be necessary to initiate and complete a 911 call.</li>
<li>Emergency red phones which ring directly to the UC Riverside Police Department.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Emergency Call Boxes</h5>
<p>The purpose of the emergency call boxes is to provide a method for people to alert the UC Riverside Police Department, of any emergency or suspicious circumstances they may observe. To activate the box, open the box, press the button, and tell the UC Riverside Police Department Dispatcher what you have seen. If in an emergency you are unable to speak, you can alert the Police simply by pressing the button. This will signal the dispatcher who will then send assistance.</p>
<h5>Non-Emergency and Routine Business</h5>
<p>Non-emergency business maybe reported and/or handled by calling ext. 25222. When off campus, dial (951) 827-5222.</p>
<h5>Confidential Reporting of Crimes</h5>
<p>Victims or witnesses may report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics by mailing a written statement or by calling the UC Riverside Police Department. Also, the University encourages pastoral counselors and professional counselors, if and when they deem appropriate, to inform the persons they are counseling to report crimes on a voluntary, confidential basis for inclusion in the annual disclosure of crime statistics by mailing a written statement to the UC Riverside Police Department, 3500 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, CA 92521, or by calling the UC Riverside Police Department at (951) 827-5222. You may also leave an <em>anonymous tip</em> on our website <a href="/anon.html">http://police.ucr.edu/anon.html</a>.</p>
<p>Crimes should be reported to the UC Riverside Police Department to ensure inclusion in the annual crime statistics and to aid in providing timely warning notices to the community, when appropriate.</p>
<h5>Reporting Hate Crimes</h5>
<p>A hate crime is any criminal act or attempted criminal act directed against a person(s), public agency or private institution based on the victim’s actual or perceived race, gender, religion, national origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, ethnicity, or disability of the victim. A hate crime includes an act that results in injury, however slight, a verbal threat of violence that apparently can be carried out, an act that results in property damage, and property loss or other criminal act(s) directed against a private or public agency.</p>
<p>Crimes routinely classified as misdemeanors can be felonies if committed because of bigotry. A conviction cannot be based on speech alone unless the speech itself threatens violence against a specific individual or group, and the defendant has the ability to carry out the threat. If you are the victim of or witness a hate crime, report it as soon as possible to the UC Riverside Police Department.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Security of and Access to Campus Facilities</strong></em></h3>
<p>Facilities and landscaping are maintained in a manner that minimizes hazardous conditions. UC Riverside Police Officers regularly patrol the campus and report malfunctioning lights and other unsafe physical conditions to the Physical Plant Department for correction. Other members of the University community are helpful when they report equipment problems to the UC Riverside Police Department or Physical Plant.</p>
<p>University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations, and Students: 40.00 “POLICY ON USE OF UNIVERSITY PROPERTIES” is available through the University of California, Office of the President’s website <a href="http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710524/PACAOS-40">http://policy.ucop.edu/doc/2710524/PACAOS-40</a>.</p>
<p>Policies governing student affairs facilities are available on the Highlander Union Building’s website <a href="http://www.highlanderunionbuilding.ucr.edu/EventScheduling/Pages/SchedulingPolicies.aspx">http://www.highlanderunionbuilding.ucr.edu/EventScheduling/Pages/SchedulingPolicies.aspx</a>.</p>
<h5>Programs Designed to Inform About Security Practices</h5>
<p>The UC Riverside Police Department presents programs to inform the community about safety and security practices. These programs occur numerous times throughout the year and include new student orientations. For information regarding these programs please contact the Crime Prevention Unit at (951) 827-1597. More information about programs and safety tips are available online at <a href="/prevention.html">http://police.ucr.edu/prevention.html</a>.</p>
<p>The Campus Safety Committee (CSC) is diverse group of University faculty, staff, administration, union representation, and other constituencies, is chaired by the Director of Environmental Health &amp; Safety. The committee meets monthly to discuss campus safety issues. The primary goal of the safety committee is to create and maintain a high level of interest and awareness in safety among all employees and to help provide a safe and healthy environment for our faculty, staff, students, and visitors. The safety committee is also a forum where any and all safety issues can be discussed. The safety committee makes recommendations for improvement in various safety related areas. For more information visit <a href="http://safety.ucr.edu">http://safety.ucr.edu</a>.    </p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Awareness and Prevention Programs to Assist Student, Staff and Faculty</strong></em></h3>
<h5>Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office</h5>
<p>The Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office (Title IX/SHO) maintains a leadership role in UCR’s commitment to a learning and workplace environment in which all persons are treated with civility, dignity, and respect. Under Title IX, Educational Amendments of 1972 and Title VII, Civil Rights Act of 1964, Title IX/SHO monitors and evaluates campus policies and procedures to ensure compliance and to provide an environment in which all members of the campus community feel supported and free of personal threat from sexual harassment and sexual violence.</p>
<p>In addition, the Title IX/SHO has the primary responsibility for educating the campus community on sexual harassment and sexual violence; providing ways to prevent sexual harassment and sexual violence; assisting individuals involved in complaints of sexual harassment; assisting victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking; and investigating and resolving complaints of sexual harassment and sexual violence. Sexual harassment prevention education presentations are available to all members of the UCR community. These presentations increase awareness and provide information and resources about issues such as sexual harassment, sexual assault, rape prevention, dating/domestic violence and stalking. To request a presentation, contact Rhonda Dixon, Sexual Harassment/Sexual Violence Educator at (951) 827-5670 or <a href="mailto:rhonda.dixon@ucr.edu">rhonda.dixon@ucr.edu</a>.</p>
<p>On March 7, 2013, President Obama signed into federal law the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act of 2013 (VAWA), which is aimed at improving how colleges and universities in the U.S. address sexual violence. This new law imposes obligations for the University of California to revise its policy and practices to comply with new regulations that addresses and prohibits acts of violence such as, sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, and it clarifies the rights of victims. The new regulations also include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reporting campus crime statistics beyond the crime categories that the Clery Act already mandates, to which now include incidents of domestic violence, dating violence and stalking, as well as crimes motivated by gender identity or national origin;</li>
<li>Providing comprehensive educational prevention and awareness programs for incoming students and new employees, in addition to ongoing prevention and awareness campaigns for students, faculty and employees that identifies and defines sexual assault, rape, acquaintance rape, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking; and</li>
<li>Conducting annual training for investigators and hearing officers who investigate and review reported offenses.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, both Title IX and VAWA legislation permits the University of California, Riverside to assist both the victim and the accused with:</p>
<ul>
<li>An investigation</li>
<li>Counseling and medical services</li>
<li>Using the Campus Safety Escort Service</li>
<li>Choosing a support person to accompany them throughout proceedings</li>
<li>Allowing the victim and the accused to attend different classes</li>
<li>Academic support services</li>
</ul>
<h5 class="StyleHeading5Right0LinespacingMultiple115li"><strong>Campus Advocacy Resources and Education (CARE)</strong></h5>

<h5>University of California Police Department at Riverside</h5>
<p>It is well recognized that the prevention of crime provides the best measure of protection. Therefore, the UC Riverside Police Department operates as a proactive crime prevention unit that works closely with the members of the community to make UCR a safer place to work, live and learn.</p>
<p>The UC Riverside Police Department provides and/or collaborates in presentations on topics such as personal safety, vehicle and residential security, office and equipment security, sexual assault prevention, and guidelines for how to respond to a crisis.</p>
<p>Brochures and literature on crime prevention and personal safety are available through the UC Riverside Police Department’s Detective and Crime Prevention Office you can contact them via e-mail <a href="mailto:CrimePrevention@ucr.edu">CrimePrevention@ucr.edu</a> or call (951) 827-1597.</p>
<p>In order to increase the level of crime awareness and campus safety at UCR, incidents of criminal activity within the campus community are publicized in many ways: distribution of the UCR PD Annual Report and Crime Statistics; maintenance of an ongoing "crime log;" dissemination of Community Crime Alert Bulletins (posters and mass e-mail notifications); the "Rap Sheet" column in the Highlander student newspaper; articles in the weekly UCReport; "Crime Watch" columns in the campus housing newsletters; via regular police activity reports to campus housing administrators; and through crime prevention programs.</p>
<p>In recent years UCR has experienced growth in the programs that target safety and security. For example, lighting has been improved at many locations around the campus, and several new Emergency Call Boxes (ECBs) have been installed and placed into service. In 2008 UCR implemented use of the Everbridge system to provide the community with alert and updates on safety related incidents. Community members can sign up to receive notifications via text message, land line telephone, and e-mail. For more information and to sign up, please follow this link <a href="http://cnc.ucr.edu/ens">http://cnc.ucr.edu/ens</a>. It is anticipated that as the population of UCR increases, so will the personnel, support services and programs designated for safety and security on the campus.</p>
<p>UC Riverside Police Department provides a web link at <a>http://police.ucr.edu</a> to a digital crime map. This crime map is updated daily to provide the public and our community with the most accurate and up to date information. You may access it directly with this link <a href="/acknowledge.html">http://police.ucr.edu/acknowledge.html</a>.</p>
<p>UC Riverside Police Department provides many training opportunities to our community, faculty, students and staffs by our Crime Prevention Officer you can contact them via e-mail <a href="mailto:CrimePrevention@ucr.edu">CrimePrevention@ucr.edu</a> or call (951) 827-1597.

<p>The City of Riverside and the University of California at Riverside have created a partnership to enhance the vehicle, bicyclist and pedestrian traffic safety in the heavily traveled areas around the university through the installation and upgrading of the City of Riverside’s traffic camera program. The cameras monitor busy intersections, sidewalks and bicycle lanes and are designated with blue and white traffic signs posted in high visibility areas on light posts.</p>
<p>Crime prevention efforts and tips by UC Riverside Police Department are done in a variety of ways on an ongoing basis. Some examples are: using social media; providing articles for The Highlander campus newspaper and ROAR, the Housing newsletter; provide tabling at events with give-a-way items such as keychains and whistles with UC Riverside Police Department’s phone number and webpage address; providing bookmarks with campus safety partner information and DUI and Drug Awareness Information with THE WELL.</p>
<h5>Residential Buildings</h5>
<p>UC Riverside provides housing to approximately 7,500 students, from apartments designed for students with children to multi-student apartment complexes and residential buildings. The UC Riverside Police Department, Student Housing staff, and apartment managers for on-campus private housing work closely together to create a safer and more comfortable living and learning environment. The Security of residential areas involves on-duty housing staff, apartment managers, Community Service Officers and around-the-clock UC Riverside Police Department patrols. To provide residents with timely notice of major crimes or threats to the campus, Student Housing staff and apartment staff promptly post all Crime Alert Bulletins.</p>
<p>Although all residence halls are accessible only by key/card key 24 hours a day, residents must also take an active role to ensure their own security. Always use common sense, and learn and follow campus security procedures. In addition, since the campus is open, and visitors to residence halls and apartments are not restricted or monitored, residents need to be alert and aware of their surroundings.</p>
<p>To maintain the safety and security of residence halls, residents and visitors must ensure that locked buildings stay closed and locked. Keep your room or apartment door locked, always carry your key, take precautions to protect your keys against theft or loss, and report immediately any theft/loss of your building or room keys. In addition, do not open the door for unknown persons, and alert residence hall staff and the UC Riverside Police Department if you notice improper entry (someone climbing over a fence) or suspicious activity (a stranger leaving your friend's room carrying his or her computer).</p>
<h5>Non-Residential Buildings</h5>
<p>Our campus has over 264 buildings comprising almost 3 million square feet. Burglars or others intent on crime may target these structures. Although most buildings can be accessed by key after business hours, many are locked and alarmed after 5 p.m. It is essential that staff, faculty, and students cooperate to keep closed facilities locked. To prevent unauthorized entrance to campus buildings, DO NOT prop doors open, leave doors unlocked, or open the door for people you do not know. In addition, protect the security of campus keys, and report immediately any loss or theft of keys.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Missing Persons Notification Policy</strong></em></h3>
<h5>Missing Students who reside in Campus Housing</h5>
<p>UC Riverside takes the safety and welfare of our students very seriously. To that end, each student living in a campus housing facility has the opportunity to register the name and contact information of a person he or she would like notified if the student is found to be missing and cannot be located through reasonable outreach and investigation. Missing person contact information is registered confidentially and is accessible only to authorized campus officials in furtherance of a missing person investigation. Housing authorities will notify the UC Riverside Police Department in the event of any resident student who is discovered to be missing.</p>
<p>The UC Riverside Police Department will take any missing person’s report which is reported to them without delay regardless of jurisdiction. A missing person report will be given investigative priority over non-emergency property crimes. If you believe that any member of the campus community is missing or is in any danger, do not hesitate to report it to UC Riverside Police Department, immediately.</p>
<p>When an officer receives a report of a missing person, the officer will determine the category of missing person and complete a report. The reporting officer will ensure that the appropriate information is entered into the California and National Missing Persons data base. If the missing person is a student; the reporting UC Riverside Police Officer will also ensure notification is made to the student’s missing person’s contact, if available, within 24 hours of the initial report. If the missing person is under 18 and not emancipated, UC Riverside Police will notify a custodial parent or guardian.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Reporting Suspected Misconduct by Students, Staff, Faculty, or Student Organizations</strong></em></h3>
<p>If those suspected of committing a crime are University students, staff or faculty members, you may, in addition to filing a police report, report the suspected misconduct for possible disciplinary action.</p>
<p>To report suspected misconduct by a UC Riverside student or student organization, call or e-mail the Student Conduct and Academic Integrity Office (951) 827-4208 or e-mail <a href="mailto:conduct@ucr.edu">conduct@ucr.edu</a>. University of California Standards of Conduct for Students prohibit physical assault, including sexual assault; threats of violence; and conduct that threatens health or safety, sexual harassment; stalking; illegal use or possession of weapons, explosives, drugs or alcohol; theft; vandalism; misuse of computer resources; and other crimes and misconduct. Students who commit crimes maybe prosecuted criminally as well as disciplined by the campus. Students and student organizations maybe disciplined for off-campus conduct that threatens health, safety or security.</p>
<p>If a formal student disciplinary hearing is held, both the complainant and the accused have the same rights to be present at the hearing, and both have the same right to be accompanied by an advisor at any stage of the process. If the incident involved an alleged crime of violence or an alleged sex offense, both the alleged victim and the accused student are notified of the final decision in the disciplinary proceeding and any sanctions imposed. If the complainant is deceased as a result of the crime, the disclosure will be made, upon request, to the complainant’s next of kin. A finding that the violation was intentional, forcible, violent, or motivated by hatred or bias normally results in a sanction of Suspension or Dismissal.</p>
<p>UC Riverside staff or faculty members maybe subject to disciplinary action under applicable personnel policies or collective bargaining agreements. Questions about or reports of alleged staff misconduct maybe directed to UC Riverside Human Resources, (951) 827- 3641 or visit <a href="http://hr.ucr.edu/supervisor/labor.html">http://hr.ucr.edu/supervisor/labor.html</a>.</p>

<h5>Weapons on Campus</h5>
<p>All weapons are prohibited on the UC Riverside campus, whether in a book bag, in the car, or in an office, classroom, or apartment. Except for sworn police officers or federal law enforcement officials, it is a felony to bring or possess ANY firearm on any California school, college, or university campus (§626.9 PC). It is also a felony to possess any air gun - including pellet and BB guns that utilize air, CO2, or spring pressure to propel a projectile (§626.10 PC). In addition to firearms, knives with a rigid blade length of over two and one half inches, dirks, daggers, metal knuckles, nunchaku (nunchucks), and ice picks are illegal.</p>
<p>If you see a gun or other weapon on University property, please alert the police immediately at (951) 827-5222 with a description of the location of the weapon and/or the individual carrying it. If you believe that the weapon is being or is about to be used, dial 911 from a land-line, and from a cell phone, dial (951) 827-5222.</p>
<h5>Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and Stalking</h5>
<p>The University has procedures in place that serve to be sensitive to those who report sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking. These procedures include informing individuals about their right to file criminal charges as well as the availability of medical, counseling and support services, and additional remedies to prevent contact between a complainant and an accused party, such as housing, academic, transportation and working accommodations, if reasonably available. Students and employees should contact the University’s Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office at (951) 827‐7070, located at 349 Surge Building, for assistance in handling concerns involving sexual assault and sexual violence.</p>
<h5>If you have been the Victim of Sexual Assault, Domestic Violence, Dating Violence and/or Stalking</h5>
<p>After an incident of sexual assault, domestic violence or dating violence the victim should consider seeking medical attention as soon as possible. In the event of a sexual assault, the victim may seek medical attention at the Riverside County Regional Medical Center (951) 486‐5650 for a sexual assault evidence examination. In California, for incidents involving sexual assault, evidence maybe collected even if you chose not to make a report to law enforcement—you can decide later on whether or not to report it to law enforcement. It is important that a victim of sexual assault not bathe, douche, smoke, change clothing or clean the bed/linen/area where they were assaulted if the offense occurred within the past 120 hours (5 days) so criminal activity may be preserved. In cases involving sexual assault, if victims do not wish to take a sexual assault evidence examination, health care providers can still treat injuries and take steps to address concerns of pregnancy and/or sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>Victims of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking are encouraged to also preserve evidence by saving text messages, instant messages, social networking pages, other communications, and keeping pictures, logs or other copies of documents, if they have any that would be useful to University investigators or police. Although the University strongly encourages all members of the campus community to report sexual assault and sexual violence to law enforcement, it is the victim’s choice whether or not to make such a report and victims have the right to decline involvement with the police. The University’s Sexual Assault Resource Services Consultant at (951) 827‐6225 will assist any victim with notifying local law enforcement such as, the City of Riverside Police Department (951) 826‐5314 or the UC Riverside Police Department at (951) 827‐5222 if they so desire. A list of contacts for UC Riverside Police Department may be found online at <a href="/contact.html">http://police.ucr.edu/contact.html</a>.</p>
<p>As time passes, evidence may dissipate or become lost or unavailable which might make it more difficult to investigate, possible for prosecution, disciplinary proceedings, or obtaining a protection order from abuse, If a victim chooses not to make a report regarding an incident, he or she nevertheless should consider speaking with UC Riverside Police Department (or any law enforcement agency) about preserving evidence in the event that the victim changes his/her mind at a later date.</p>
<h5>Victim’s Rights</h5>
<p>In California, a victim of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking has the following right to: 1) Be informed of Riverside County District Attorney’s decision to decline hearing or dismiss the case along with information about seeking restraining order; 2) Protection against employer retaliation for victims to take reasonable time off to attend order for protection or harassment restraining order proceedings; 3) Domestic abuse victims have the ability to terminate a lease without penalty; 4) Sexual assault victims can make a confidential request for HIV testing of a convicted offender; 5) Sexual assault victims do not have to pay the cost of a sexual assault examination; and 6) Sexual assault victims may not be required to undergo a polygraph examination in order for an investigation or prosecution to proceed.</p>
<h5>Campus Sexual Assault Victims’ Bill of Rights</h5>
<p>The “Campus Sexual Assault Victims’ Bill of Rights” exists as a part of the campus security reporting requirements, commonly known as the Jeanne Clery Act. Federal law entitles victims of sexual assault/sexual violence to the follow rights:</p>
<ul>
<li>Victims shall be notified of their options to notify law enforcement.</li>
<li>Accuser and accused must have the same opportunity to have others present.</li>
<li>Both parties shall be informed of the outcome of any disciplinary proceeding.</li>
<li>Victims shall be notified of counseling services.</li>
<li>Victims shall be notified of options for changing academic and living situations.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Orders of Protection for Victims</h5>
<p>Any person who obtains a restraining order should provide a copy to UC Riverside Police Department. A complainant might then meet with the UC Riverside Police to develop a Safety Action Plan, which is a plan for the UC Riverside Police Department and the victim to reduce the risk of harm while on campus or coming and going from campus. This plan may include, additional resources from UCR Student Affairs, Housing and Conduct may include but is not limited to: special parking arrangements, providing a temporary cell phone, changing classroom location, allowing a student to complete assignments from home, or placing the offender on the Exclusionary List and/or issue a No Contact Order etc.</p>
<p>If you experience physical or emotional abuse, threats, stalking, harassment, or other acts of violence, and you wish to restrain a person from having contact with you, you can apply for a restraining order at the Riverside County Family Justice Center at 3900 Orange Street, Riverside, CA 92501. Or you may go online to obtain the document at <a href="http://riverside.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/domesticviolence.shtml">http://riverside.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/domesticviolence.shtml</a>. If you are in immediate danger, call 911. A law enforcement officer can issue an Emergency Protective Order which is upheld from 5 to 7 days.</p>
<h5>Confidentiality</h5>
<p>To the extent of the victim’s cooperation and consent, university officials, including Director/Title IX Compliance Officer (Sexual Harassment Officer), managers, supervisors, and other designated employees, will provide confidential resources to which victims/survivors can consult for advice and information regarding making a report of sexual assault or sexual violence. These resources will provide victims/survivors who may be interested in reporting a sexual assault or sexual violence incident with a safe place to discuss their concerns and learn about the procedures and potential outcomes involved. Individuals who consult with confidential resources will be advised that their discussions in these settings are not considered reports of sexual assault or sexual violence and that without additional action by the complainant, the discussions will not result in any action by the University to resolve their concerns. The confidential resources at UCR that protect complainant’s privacy and ensure confidentiality to the extent possible by law and policy are the Student Counseling Center (951) 827-5531, Office of the Ombudsman (951) 827-3213, and the Faculty and Staff Employee Assistance Program (951) 781-0510 or (800) 266-0510. In circumstances involving safe‐based accommodations, these confidential resources and other offices on campus (responsible for assisting) will work to ensure that the complainant’s physical safety, work and academic status are protected, pending the outcome of a formal university investigation of the complaint. For example, if reasonably available, a complainant maybe offered changes to academic accommodations, student housing, or workplace situations in addition to counseling, health services and assistance in notifying appropriate campus or local law enforcement. Other offices responsible for assisting the victim/survivor with safe‐based accommodations are the Sexual Assault Resource Services Consultant (951) 827-6225, the Student Affairs Case Manager (951) 827-9354, Assistant Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs (951) 827-4641, and/or Labor Relations (951) 827-3641.</p>
<p>Additionally, personal identifiable information about the victim will be treated as confidential and only shared with persons with a specific need to know who is investigating/adjudicating the complaint or delivering resources or support services to the complainant. The University does not publish the name of crime victims nor house identifiable information regarding victims in the UC Riverside Police Department’s Daily Crime Log or online. Victims may request that directory information online (for employees) or the Growl system (for students) be removed to avoided being public by request. If you are an employee, you may contact your department’s Financial and Administrative Officer (FAO) or Management Service Officer (MSO) or designated person. If you are a student, you will need to go into the Growl system and check the box that says you do not want your information to be public. The confidentiality of accommodations or protective measures provided to the victim will be maintained to the extent that such confidentiality will not impair the ability of the institution to provide such accommodations/protective measures.</p>
<h5>Disciplinary Procedures Following a Complaint</h5>
<p>Whether or not criminal charges are filed, the university or a person may file a complaint under the University’s Policies and Procedures for Responding to Reports of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence alleging that a student or employee violated the University’s policy. Reports of all sexual assaults, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking made to UC Riverside Police Department will automatically be referred to the Title IX/Sexual Harassment Office for investigation regardless if the complainant choses to pursue criminal charges.</p>
<p>The University’s disciplinary process will include a prompt, fair, and impartial investigation and resolution process. Investigator(s) and hearing board members are trained annually on the issues related to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking and taught how to conduct a hearing process that protects the safety of the victim and promotes accountability.</p>
<p>The policy provides that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The complainant and the accused may each have a representative present when he or she is interviewed, and at any subsequent proceeding or related meeting. A representative may only consult and advise his or her advisee, but not speak for the advisee at any meeting or hearing;</li>
<li>The complainant and accused will be informed if there were findings made that the policy was or was not violated and of actions taken to resolve the complaint, if any, that are directly related to the complainant, such as an order that the accused not contact the complainant. In accordance with University policies protecting individuals’ privacy, the complainant may generally be notified that the matter has been referred for disciplinary action, but will not be informed of the details of the recommended disciplinary action without the consent of the accused; A conduct decision is based on the preponderance of evidence standard, i.e. “more likely than not to have occurred” standard. In other words, the conduct process asks: “is it more likely than not that the accused violated the university’s policy”;</li>
<li>At the conclusion of any disciplinary proceeding arising from an allegation of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking, the complainant and the accused will be simultaneously informed in writing of: 1) The outcome of any University disciplinary proceeding; 2) The University’s procedures for appealing the results of the proceeding; 3) any change to the results that occur prior to the time that such results become final; and 4) When results become final.</li>
<li>In a conduct decision involving a student, the complainant and the accused both have the right to appeal the outcome of the conduct hearing by submitting a written appeal to the Assistant Dean of Students within ten working days of receiving written notification of the decision; and the complainant or the accused will be notified simultaneously in writing of the final outcome after the appeal is resolved. For more information about how to appeal a conduct decision then go online to Administration of the Standards of Conduct 10.00 at <a href="http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/administrationofstandards.html">http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/administrationofstandards.html</a>.</li>
<li>A person reporting sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, or stalking may utilize the complaint and investigatory procedures set forth in the University’s Policies and Procedures for Responding to Reports of Sexual Harassment and Sexual Violence at http://titleix.ucr.edu in order to remedy any hostile environment. All conduct proceedings involving students, will be resolved through the Sexual Violence and University of California Policies Applying to Campus Activities, Organizations &amp; Students online at <a href="http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/index.html">http://conduct.ucr.edu/policies/index.html</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>In all cases, investigations that result in a finding of more likely than not that a violation of the policy occurred will lead to the initiation of disciplinary procedures against the accused individual. The University may implement protective measures following the report of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and/or stalking. A protective measure usually includes a “stay‐away” provision, prohibiting the accused from having contact with the victim. A protective measure may include a restraining order issued by a California court which specifies a list of places on campus where the accused is prohibited from entering, under the reasoning that these are places where the accused go to regularly and the accused does not have a need to visit. For example, the classroom, workplace, a laboratory, campus child daycare center, anywhere the accused might go to on a regular basis. In addition, protective measure issued administratively may include a “No Contact Order”, “Suspension”, “Interim Suspension”, “Investigatory Leave”, or add them to the “Exclusionary List.” Students or employees who violate policy will be subjected to discipline up to and including dismissal from the University. Sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence, and stalking are criminal acts which also may subject the accused to criminal and civil penalties under federal and state law.</p>
<h5>Disciplinary Procedures for Employees</h5>
<p>UCR staff appointees are governed by a number of disciplinary policies, depending upon their appointment type and bargaining unit assignment. For further information about policies governing employee discipline, please contact the Office of Employee &amp; Labor Relations at (951) 827-3641.</p>

<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Risk Reduction, Warning Signs of Abusive Behavior and Future Attacks</strong></em></h3>
<p>No victim is ever to blame for being assaulted or abused. Unfortunately, a person who is the victim of sexual or dating violence is more likely to be re‐victimized. Below are some tips to help reduce your risk, to recognize warnings signs of abusive behavior and how to avoid potential attacks.</p>
<h5>Warning Signs of Abusive Behavior</h5>
<p>Domestic and dating abuse often escalates from threats and verbal abuse to violence. And, while physical injury maybe the most obvious danger, the emotional and psychological consequences of domestic and dating violence are also severe.</p>
<p>Warning signs of dating and domestic violence include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Being afraid of your partner.</li>
<li>Constantly watching what you say to avoid a “blow up.”</li>
<li>Feelings of low self‐worth and helplessness about your relationship.</li>
<li>Feeling isolated from family or friends because of your relationship.</li>
<li>Hiding bruises or other injuries from family or friends.</li>
<li>Being prevented from working, studying, going home, and/or using technology (including your cell phone).</li>
<li>Being monitored by your partner at home, work or school.</li>
<li>Being forced to do things you don’t want to do.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Reduce Your Risk and Avoid Potential Attacks</h5>
<p>If you are being abused or suspect that someone you know is being abused, speak up and/or intervene.</p>
<ul>
<li>Get help by contacting the Counseling Center or Health Center for support services.</li>
<li>Learn how to look for “red flags” in relationships so you can learn to avoid some of those characteristics in future partners.</li>
<li>Consider making a report with Campus Police and/or the Title IX Compliance Officer and ask for a “no contact” directive from the University to prevent future contact.</li>
<li>Consider getting a restraining order from the Riverside County Family Justice Center, located at 3900 Orange Street, Riverside, CA 92501.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>           Or you may go online to obtain the document at </em><a href="http://riverside.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/domesticviolence.shtml"><em>http://riverside.courts.ca.gov/selfhelp/domesticviolence.shtml</em></a><em>. </em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn more about what behaviors constitute dating and domestic violence, understand it is not your fault, and talk with friends and family members about ways you can be supported.</li>
<li>Trust your instincts: if something doesn’t feel right in a relationship, speak up or end it.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Sexual Assault Prevention (From RAINN)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Be aware of rape drugs</li>
<li>Try not to leave your drink unattended</li>
<li>Only drink from un‐opened containers or from drinks you have watched being made and poured</li>
<li>Avoid group drinks like punch bowls</li>
<li>Cover your drink. It is easy to slip in a small pill even while you are holding your drink. Hold a cup with your hand over the top, or choose drinks that are contained in a bottle and keep your thumb over the nozzle</li>
<li>If you feel extremely tired or drunk for no apparent reason, you may have been drugged. Find your friends and ask them to leave with you as soon as possible</li>
<li>If you suspect you have been drugged, go to a hospital and ask to be tested</li>
<li>Keep track of how many drinks you have had</li>
<li>Try to come and leave with a group of people you trust</li>
<li>Avoid giving out your personal information (phone number, where you live, etc.). If someone asks for your number, take his/her number instead of giving out yours</li>
</ul>
<h5>Traveling Around Campus (Walking)</h5>
<ul>
<li>Make sure your cell phone is easily accessible and fully charged</li>
<li>Be familiar with where emergency phones are installed on the campus</li>
<li>Be aware of open buildings where you can use a phone</li>
<li>Keep some change accessible just in case you need to use a pay phone</li>
<li>Take major, public paths rather than less populated shortcuts</li>
<li>Avoid dimly lit places and talk to campus services if lights need to be installed in an area</li>
<li>Avoid putting music headphones in both ears so that you can be more aware of your surroundings, especially if you are walking alone</li>
<li>Walking back from the library very late at night is sometimes unavoidable, so try to walk with a friend</li>
<li>Carry a noisemaker (like a whistle) on your keychain</li>
<li>Carry a small flashlight on your keychain</li>
<li>If walking feels unsafe, try calling the campus Safety Escort Service (951) 827‐3772 which is located on the 1st floor of the Highlander Union Building (HUB).</li>
</ul>
<h5>Location of Registered Sex Offender Information</h5>
<p>California law requires sex offenders who are employed, volunteer, are a resident of, or enrolled as a student at an institution of higher education, to register with the campus police. If you would like information concerning registered sex offenders in California, check the Megan’s law web site at <a href="http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov">http://www.meganslaw.ca.gov</a>. You can search the database by a sex offender's specific name, or geographically by entering the ZIP Code, or city/county to obtain information on registrants residing in a specific area.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>E</strong></em><em><strong>mergency Notifications and Timely Warnings</strong></em></h3>
<hr/>
<p>In the event of a substantiated emergency or on-going threat to public safety on or near University property, diligent efforts are made to notify members of the UCR community. These efforts are in accordance with the federal Clery Act, which requires universities and colleges to notify students and employees in a timely manner if a significant emergency or on-going threat to public safety on or near University property occurs. Such notification shall be made without delay. On a case-by-case basis, the University may defer notification only if doing so would compromise efforts to assist victims or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency.</p>
<h5>What is the UCR Emergency Notification System?</h5>
<p>The UCR Emergency Notification System was developed by Environmental Health &amp; Safety (EH&amp;S), UC Riverside Police Department, Computing &amp; Communications, and Strategic Communications. It is designed to notify subscription holders (students, staff and faculty) via a variety of electronic tools and systems, including electronic text messaging.</p>
<h5>Dissemination of UCR Emergency System Notifications</h5>
<p>UCR will use the UCR Emergency Notification System to notify and update the UCR community (and the larger local community) about the emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees is occurring on campus. The system includes the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>UCR Emergency Text Messaging</li>
<li>UCR Campus Status Website</li>
<li>Emergency Communications Listserv (e-mail)</li>
<li>Campus Status Website</li>
<li>Scotmail (e-mail)</li>
<li>888-UCR-WARN (recorded message line)</li>
<li>Voicemail Blast (distributed voicemail)</li>
<li>R’Web – Student Portal <a href="http://www.rweb.ucr.edu/">http://www.rweb.ucr.edu</a></li>
<li>R’Space – Faculty/Staff Portal <a href="http://www.rspace.ucr.edu/">http://www.rspace.ucr.edu</a></li>
</ul>
<h5>Issuing an Immediate UCR Emergency Notification</h5>
<p>The UCR Emergency Notification system will be used when an emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees is occurring on campus. On a case-by-case basis, the University may defer notification only if doing so compromises efforts to assist victims or to contain, respond to, or otherwise mitigate the emergency. An Emergency Notification mayor may not be related to criminal activity. Importantly, depending on the circumstance, various components of the Emergency Notification System will be utilized (e.g. text messaging and e-mail only) that best address and ameliorate the situation at hand. Examples of circumstances under which the University may issue an Emergency Notification include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>active shooter</li>
<li>building collapse</li>
<li>natural disaster on or threatening the campus</li>
<li>large explosion or major fire</li>
<li>hazardous spills</li>
</ul>
<h5>Authorized Users of UCR Emergency Notification System Mediums</h5>
<p>The following personnel are authorized and trained to send emergency text notifications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Campus Emergency Manager</li>
<li>Chief of Police</li>
<li>Assistant Chief of Police</li>
<li>Lieutenant of Police</li>
<li>UC Riverside Police Department Public Safety Dispatchers (or police staff as determined by the Chief of Police)</li>
<li>UCR Training Director of Enterprise Risk Management</li>
<li>UCR Computing &amp; Communications Associate Director, Computing Support Services</li>
</ul>
<h5>Technological Support of the Emergency Notification System Provided By</h5>
<ul>
<li>Director of Educational Technologies and Computing Support</li>
<li>Systems / Network Project Manager</li>
<li>UCR’s AVC C&amp;C</li>
</ul>
<h5>Decision, Procedure, Timing and Content Criteria for a UCR Emergency Notification</h5>
<ul>
<li>The decision to send UCR Emergency Notifications may be made by the UC Riverside Police Department watch commander or Campus Emergency Manager. Depending upon the circumstances, the decision may be made in consultation with campus or local officials for information related an emergency or dangerous situation involving an immediate threat to the health or safety of students or employees.</li>
<li>The procedure for sending the emergency text message is as follows: The message will be sent via the emergency text messaging phone application. If that function is not available, the message may be sent via the emergency text messaging website or via a phone operator. The message should be sent by UC Riverside Police Department Public Safety Dispatcher or police staff as designated by the Chief of Police or other authorized users.</li>
<li>The Emergency Notification System will be activated as soon as reasonably possible and without delay.</li>
<li>The first step of an emergency notification, if possible, is to update the campus Status Page with information about the situation at hand. All further communications then reference the Status webpage.</li>
<li>An emergency text message to the UCR community will be brief and will include 1) the nature of the emergency, 2) location of the emergency, and 3) directions or instructions on actions the community should take in response. After the initial notification, updated information may be disseminated to the community via additional text messages and/or other mediums (see previous page).</li>
<li>In conjunction with broad campus messaging, the Emergency Notification System allows for information to be addressed to specific segments of the campus community (faculty, staff, students, buildings, departments) and information to specific campus populations may be disseminated using the system.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Business and Operational Continuity</h5>
<p>Depending upon the nature of the incident and corresponding emergency notifications, some or all campus operations, services or business activities may be delayed or discontinued until safe conditions are re-established. Depending on the nature of the incident, UCR’s leadership team (Chancellor, Provost, Vice Chancellors, Deans, etc.) or UCR’s Executive Management Policy Group (EMPG) will be notified via text, phone call or e-mail by the Vice Chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, the Campus Emergency Manager or the UC Riverside Police Department so appropriate continuity, logistic and communication information is disseminated to faculty, staff, and students. This may include but is not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alternative classes or instructional schedules and locations</li>
<li>Information pertaining to daily operations and services (i.e. Housing &amp; Dinning, Transportation &amp; Parking)</li>
<li>Cancelation of pre-planned or on-going special events or meetings</li>
</ul>
<h5>Regular System Testing</h5>
<p>UCR will test the emergency notification systems/procedures at least annually, including publicizing its procedures at least once per calendar year. The University will document a description of the exercise, as well as the date and time of the exercise and whether it was announced or unannounced. The actual use of the Emergency Notification System also constitutes additional system testing. Additionally, the components of the Emergency Notification System will be reviewed on a quarterly basis by a technology oversight group comprised of:</p>
<ul>
<li>AVC/CIO – Computing &amp; Communications</li>
<li>UC Riverside Police Department Chief of Police (or designee)</li>
<li>AVC Strategic Communications</li>
<li>Director, EH&amp;S (or designee)</li>
<li>Campus Fire Marshal</li>
<li>Campus Emergency Manager</li>
</ul>
<h5>Timely Warnings</h5>
<p>In the event a situation arises either on or near campus, that, in the judgment of the UC Riverside Police Department’s Chief of Police (or designee) or other Senior University Officials, constitutes an ongoing or continuing threat to the community, a campus-wide “timely warning” will be issued. The warning maybe issued using any or all of the tools and systems noted in this document. It is the primary responsibility of the UC Riverside Police Department’s Chief of Police (or his/her designee) or other Senior University Officials to issue a campus-wide timely warning of serious crimes or series or pattern of criminal behaviors that may pose a threat to the UCR community. A timely warning will be issued as soon as pertinent information is available.</p>
<h5>What is a UCR PD Crime Alert?</h5>
<p>A UCR PD Crime Alert is primarily a timely warning Scotmail (e-mail) to students, faculty and staff from the UC Riverside Police Department’s Chief of Police or designee to the campus community when a serious crime constituting a threat to students and employees has reportedly occurred on or very near to campus. UC Riverside Police Department’s Crime Alerts may also be sent, if there is a pattern of criminal behavior.</p>
<h5>Issuing a UCR PD Crime Alert</h5>
<p>UCR PD Crime Alerts are sent for the following: Arson, criminal homicide, sex offenses, aggravated assaults, robberies, or a pattern of criminal behavior. As with all warnings, decisions about UCR PD Crime Alerts will be made on a case-by-case basis. For example, if a fight (assault) occurs between two students who have a disagreement that poses no known threat to the UCR community; no UCR PD Crime Alert would be sent.</p>
<h5>Timing, Content and Decision Criteria for a UCR PD Crime Alert</h5>
<ul>
<li>The UCR PD Crime Alert should be sent when pertinent information and facts related to a serious crime or are available and enable the UCR community members to better protect themselves within a reasonable and timely manner.</li>
<li>The UCR PD Crime Alert will specify the type of crime, time of occurrence, location and the available pertinent information in the prevention of similar crimes and to enable the campus community to protect themselves.</li>
<li>The issuance of a UCR PD Crime alert must be decided on a case-by-case basis and in light of the nature and facts surrounding the crime, continuing danger to the campus community and the possible risk of compromising law enforcement efforts.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Dissemination of the UCR PD Crime Alerts</h5>
<p>UCR PD Crime Alerts will be sent via electronic Scotmail (e-mail) to UCR students, faculty and staff subscribers listed on a campus group e-mail. UC Riverside Police Department will electronically post Crime Alerts on the UC Riverside Police Department’s website. UCR Departments, staff and faculty can also post these alerts in highly visible areas and lounges.</p>
<h5>Authorized Users of UCR PD Crime Alerts</h5>
<ul>
<li>UC Riverside Police Department’s Chief of Police</li>
<li>UC Riverside Police Department’s Assistant Chief of Police</li>
<li>UC Riverside Police Department’s Lieutenants</li>
</ul>

<p>The emergency notification and evacuation procedures are described in the <strong><em>Emergency Action Plan</em></strong>, maintained online at <a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/emergency_action_plan.pdf">http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/emergency_action_plan.pdf</a>, and shared through the Safety Orientation Training Course at <a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu/training/online/safetyorientation/indexlms.html">http://ehs.ucr.edu/training/online/safetyorientation/indexlms.html</a> with the campus community. When it comes to evacuation, the general steps are for the campus community to take actions prior to exiting, follow evacuation routes, and moving towards the Emergency Assembly Area(s). Once evacuated, there are emergency staff who account for employees and coordinate rescue and medical service. This document also describes the policies and procedures for emergency communications, which is multi-layered and redundant to ensure that as many people are reached as possible. The notification systems include: building fire alarms, text messaging from the Emergency Notification System, verbal notification, e-mail, websites, voicemail systems, and radios.  </p>
<ul>
<li>Emergency Procedures (For the Community)</li>
</ul>
<p>The evacuation procedures are maintained online at <a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/procedures">http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/procedures</a>, and shared through training courses with the campus community.  These procedures were created with the goal of answering the question of what to do. Everyone accesses these procedures by visiting the Emergency Procedures at above link, and clicking on “Evacuation.” Additionally, training courses describe the evacuation procedures, Emergency Assembly Areas, and actions to take after a significant emergency or dangerous situation. The overall procedure is to quickly leave the building when the fire alarm sounds, or evacuation is initiated by emergency staff, follow evacuation routes to the Emergency Assembly Area, and notify emergency staff that they have evacuated safely.</p>

<h5>Emergency Response and Evacuation Testing Procedures</h5>
<p>Unannounced evacuation (fire) drills are conducted as required by the California Fire Code, by UC Riverside EH&amp;S for all on-campus student housing facilities. Additional evacuation drills are also conducted each year for federally funded campus facilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>During these exercises, participants are trained on the locations of emergency exits, general evacuation paths for their building, and their Emergency Assembly Areas. For longer-term evacuations additional designated evacuation areas may be identified based on time of day, location of the building being evacuated, the availability of various locations on campus, and other factors such as the location and nature of the threat. When a building is evacuated, UC Riverside police officers and building staff on the scene will communicate information regarding the developing situation or any evacuation status changes.</li>
<li>The purpose of evacuation drills is to prepare building occupants, students, faculty, and staff for an organized evacuation in the case of a fire or other emergency. In addition to educating the occupants of each building about the evacuation procedures during the drill, the process also provides UC Riverside an opportunity to test the operation of fire alarm systems.</li>
</ul>
<h5>Crime and Fire Logs</h5>
<p>The UC Riverside Police Department maintains a daily crime log and a fire log that contains specified information about any and all crimes or fires [must have an actual flame to appear on this daily fire log] that occur within the patrol jurisdiction of the UC Riverside Police Department and that are reported to the UC Riverside Police Department. There is also a daily log provided by the Riverside Police Department of crimes that occurred within the UNET boundary. The daily crime log and fire log can be viewed at the UC Riverside Police Department, 3500 Canyon Crest Drive, Riverside, Ca. 92521 certain information may be withheld from the crime log under specified circumstances, primarily information that would jeopardize the success of an investigation or the safety of a person involved in the investigation. The UC Riverside Police Department makes the crime log and the fire log for the most recent 60-day period open to public inspection during normal business hours, while crime logs and fire logs containing material more than 60 days old are retained for seven years for public inspection upon two days' notice.</p>

<h5>Consent</h5>
<p>Consent is informed. Consent is an affirmative, unambiguous, and conscious decision by each participant to engage in mutually agreed-upon sexual activity. Consent is voluntary. It must be given without coercion, force, threats, or intimidation. Consent means positive cooperation in the act or expression of intent to engage in the act pursuant to an exercise of free will. Consent is revocable. Consent to some form of sexual activity does not imply consent to other forms of sexual activity. Consent to sexual activity on one occasion is not consent to engage in sexual activity on another occasion. A current or previous dating or sexual relationship, by itself, is not sufficient to constitute consent. Even in the context of a relationship, there must be mutual consent to engage in sexual activity. Consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual encounter and can be revoked at any time. Once consent is withdrawn, the sexual activity must stop immediately. Consent cannot be given when a person is incapacitated. A person cannot consent if s/he is unconscious or coming in and out of consciousness. A person cannot consent if s/he is under the threat of violence, bodily injury or other forms of coercion. A person cannot consent if his/her understanding of the act is affected by a physical or mental impairment. For purposes of this Policy, the age of consent is consistent with California Penal Code Section 261.5.</p>
<h5>Incapacitation</h5>
<p>Incapacitation is defined as the physical and/or mental inability to make informed, rational judgments. States of incapacitation include, but are not limited to, unconsciousness, sleep, and blackouts. Where alcohol or drugs are involved, incapacitation is defined with respect to how the alcohol or other drugs consumed affects a person’s decision-making capacity, awareness of consequences, and ability to make fully informed judgments. Being intoxicated by drugs or alcohol does not diminish one’s responsibility to obtain consent. The factors to be considered when determining whether consent was given include whether the accused knew, or whether a reasonable person should have known, that the complainant was incapacitated.</p>

Consent is defined under California law as positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved.</p>
</div>
<h5>Sexual Assault in the state of California is defined under the following Penal Code Sections</h5>
<p>261. (a) Rape is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person not the spouse of the perpetrator, under any of the following circumstances:</p>
<p>(1) Where a person is incapable, because of a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability, of giving legal consent, and this is known or reasonably should be known to the person committing the act. Notwithstanding the existence of a conservatorship pursuant to the provisions of the Lanterman-Petris-Short Act (Part 1 (commencing with Section 5000) of Division 5 of the Welfare and Institutions Code), the prosecuting attorney shall prove, as an element of the crime, that a mental disorder or developmental or physical disability rendered the alleged victim incapable of giving consent.</p>
<p>(2) Where it is accomplished against a person’s will by means of force, violence, duress, menace, or fear of immediate and unlawful bodily injury on the person or another.</p>
<p>(3) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known by the accused.</p>
<p>(4) Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act, and this is known to the accused. As used in this paragraph, “unconscious of the nature of the act” means incapable of resisting because the victim meets any one of the following conditions:</p>
<p>(a) Was unconscious or asleep.</p>
<p>(b) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant that the act occurred.</p>
<p>(c) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator’s fraud in fact.</p>
<p>(d) Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator’s fraudulent representation that the sexual penetration served a professional purpose when it served no professional purpose.</p>
<p>(5) Where a person submits under the belief that the person committing the act is someone known to the victim other than the accused, and this belief is induced by any artifice, pretense, or concealment practiced by the accused, with intent to induce the belief.</p>
<p>(6) Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, “threatening to retaliate” means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.</p>
<p>(7) Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used in this paragraph, “public official” means a person employed by a governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position, to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not actually have to be a public official.</p>
<p>(b)  As used in this section, “duress” means a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the defendant, are factors to consider in appraising the existence of duress.</p>
<p>(c)  As used in this section, “menace” means any threat, declaration, or act which shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.</p>
<p>261.5.  (a) Unlawful sexual intercourse is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished with a person who is not the spouse of the perpetrator, if the person is a minor. For the purposes of this section, a “minor” is a person under the age of 18 years and an “adult” is a person who is at least 18 years of age.</p>
<p>261.6.  In prosecutions under Section 261, 262, 286, 288a, or 289, in which consent is at issue, “consent” shall be defined to mean positive cooperation in act or attitude pursuant to an exercise of free will. The person must act freely and voluntarily and have knowledge of the nature of the act or transaction involved.</p>
<p>261.7.  In prosecutions under Section 261, 262, 286, 288a, or 289, in which consent is at issue, evidence that the victim suggested, requested, or otherwise communicated to the defendant that the defendant use a condom or other birth control device, without additional evidence of consent, is not sufficient to constitute consent.</p>
<p>261.9.(a) Any person convicted of seeking to procure or procuring the sexual services of a prostitute in violation of subdivision (b) of Section 647, if the prostitute is under 18 years of age, shall be ordered by the court, in addition to any other penalty or fine imposed, to pay an additional fine in an amount not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000).</p>
<p>262. (a) Rape of a person who is the spouse of the perpetrator is an act of sexual intercourse accomplished under any of the following circumstances:</p>

<p>(2) Where a person is prevented from resisting by any intoxicating or anesthetic substance, or any controlled substance, and this condition was known, or reasonably should have been known, by the accused.</p>
<p>(3) Where a person is at the time unconscious of the nature of the act, and this is known to the accused. As used in this paragraph, “unconscious of the nature of the act” means incapable of resisting because the victim meets one of the following conditions:</p>
<p>(A)   Was unconscious or asleep.</p>
<p>(B)   Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant that the act occurred.</p>
<p>(C)   Was not aware, knowing, perceiving, or cognizant of the essential characteristics of the act due to the perpetrator’s fraud in fact.</p>
<p>(4) Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will by threatening to retaliate in the future against the victim or any other person, and there is a reasonable possibility that the perpetrator will execute the threat. As used in this paragraph, “threatening to retaliate” means a threat to kidnap or falsely imprison, or to inflict extreme pain, serious bodily injury, or death.</p>
<p>(5) Where the act is accomplished against the victim’s will by threatening to use the authority of a public official to incarcerate, arrest, or deport the victim or another, and the victim has a reasonable belief that the perpetrator is a public official. As used in this paragraph, “public official” means a person employed by a governmental agency who has the authority, as part of that position, to incarcerate, arrest, or deport another. The perpetrator does not actually have to be a public official.</p>
<p>(b)  As used in this section, “duress” means a direct or implied threat of force, violence, danger, or retribution sufficient to coerce a reasonable person of ordinary susceptibilities to perform an act which otherwise would not have been performed, or acquiesce in an act to which one otherwise would not have submitted. The total circumstances, including the age of the victim, and his or her relationship to the defendant, are factors to consider in apprising the existence of duress.</p>
<p>(c)  As used in this section, “menace” means any threat, declaration, or act that shows an intention to inflict an injury upon another.</p>
<p>(d)  If probation is granted upon conviction of a violation of this section, the conditions of probation may include, in lieu of a fine, one or both of the following requirements:</p>
<p>(1) That the defendant makes payments to a battered women’s shelter, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars ($1,000).</p>
<p>(2) That the defendant reimburses the victim for reasonable costs of counseling and other reasonable expenses that the court finds are the direct result of the defendant’s offense. </p>
<p>For any order to pay a fine, make payments to a battered women’s shelter, or pay restitution as a condition of probation under this subdivision, the court shall make a determination of the defendant’s ability to pay. In no event shall any order to make payments to a battered women’s shelter be made if it would impair the ability of the defendant to pay direct restitution to the victim or court-ordered child support. Where the injury to a married person is caused in whole or in part by the criminal acts of his or her spouse in violation of this section, the community property may not be used to discharge the liability of the offending spouse for restitution to the injured spouse, required by Section 1203.04, as operative on or before August 2, 1995, or Section 1202.4, or to a shelter for costs with regard to the injured spouse and dependents, required by this section, until all separate property of the offending spouse is exhausted. </p>
<p>263. The essential guilt of rape consists in the outrage to the person and feelings of the victim of the rape. Any sexual penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete the crime.</p>

<p><strong>POLICIES §668.49(b)</strong></p>
<p><strong>a)       </strong><strong>Safety Policies §668.49(b)(4)</strong><br/>The UCR Campus fire prevention and life safety program is intended to ensure responsible and consistent protection for persons and property in, on, and exposed to UCR administered properties in conformance with California statues, regulations and University policy. The program addresses emergency incident response, fire, panic, explosion, and disaster preparedness. Fire prevention utilizes adherence to established safety procedures and controls to limit the potential for emergencies. Fire protection incorporates features and procedures to limit the effects of fires and explosions. Fire safety is a primary responsibility of all faculty, staff, and students. When a fire does occur, each individual should be capable of effectively responding to a fire emergency. Established fire safety standards and procedures shall be adopted by the University and include construction, fire investigation, exiting, occupant loads, fire drills, flammable and combustible materials, and special events. For more details, refer to the Fire Prevention and Life Safety policy/procedures found at <strong><a href="http://fboapps.ucr.edu/policies">http://fboapps.ucr.edu/policies</a></strong>.</p>
<p>                     i.      Use of Electrical Appliances (UCR Policy 425-18) In order to ensure personnel and structural safety associated with the use of electrical appliances and devices, electrical safety standards apply to all departments and units of the UCR campus, including vendors, contractors, or other entities occupying University property and the use of devices in conjunction with remodel, renovation, or construction projects by construction trades, when use of such devices are in compliance with the National Electric Code and with the California Code of Regulations.</p>
<p>                     ii.      Smoking (UCR Policy 850-65) No smoking is allowed on or within contiguous Campus properties or to UCR administered properties in conformance with California statues, regulations and University policy that will expose any Campus properties or personnel to the effects of fire.</p>
<p>                    iii.      Open Flames (UCR Policy 425-28) generally no open flame processes or uses shall be allowed without specific approvals by the Office of the Campus Fire Marshal that will expose any Campus properties or personnel to the effects of smoke or fire.</p>
<p><strong>b)       </strong><strong>Fire Evacuation Procedures §668.49(b)(5)</strong><br/>Refer to the Emergency Procedures <strong><a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/procedures">http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/procedures</a></strong> and review the UCR Emergency Action Plan (EAP). When the building’s fire alarm activates, or when notified to evacuate by UCPD, Fire Personnel, or a staff representative:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stop all activities</li>
<li>If possible to do so without endangering yourself, shut down all operations that could produce hazards if left un-attended, such as cooking, and begin your evacuation immediately.</li>
<li>Alert others around you that an evacuation is taking place and of their need to exit.</li>
<li>Close your doors as you exit, and lock them to protect your belongings.</li>
<li>Closed doors help contain fires, but locked doors do hamper response operations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Unless it creates an unnecessary delay, gather your keys, purse or wallet as you evacuate, keeping in mind you may not be allowed back into the building for an extended time.</p>
<p>During a building evacuation, proceed to the nearest exit or stairwell if available. Use an alternate escape route if the stairwell is involved with fire, smoke, or otherwise obstructed. Each resident should be aware of at least two exit routes in their main building in the event one is compromised. <strong><em>Walk, do not run, and do not use building elevators during an evacuation under any circumstances. </em></strong></p>
<p>Assist those who need assistance, especially physically challenged persons, to evacuate or in relocating them to an area of safe refuge. Do not move injured persons unless it is absolutely necessary. Persons involved with developing the local procedures need to address how to evacuate residents with special needs that are unable to evacuate on their own. Contact the Campus Emergency Manager for information and guidance on this topic.</p>
<p>Once outside, move away from the building and towards the building’s primary Emergency Assembly Area (EAA). If the primary EAA is unavailable, proceed to the alternate EAA. A map of UCR campus EAA’s can be found at: <a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/eaa.pdf">http://ehs.ucr.edu/emergency/eaa.pdf</a>.  </p>
<p><strong>c)       </strong><strong>Fire Safety Education and Training §668.49(b)(6)</strong></p>
<p>On an annual basis, Environmental Health &amp; Safety provides training to Residence Life professional staff. This includes education and training in Fire &amp; Life Safety, Electrical Safety, Fire Extinguishers, Emergency Response, and a Smoking Corridor exercise. Additionally, these components are included in the Safety Orientation course that is required of all faculty, staff, and students to take. The courses are available online 24/7 from the Environmental Health &amp; Safety website <a href="http://ehs.ucr.edu">http://ehs.ucr.edu</a> under “Training”.</p>
