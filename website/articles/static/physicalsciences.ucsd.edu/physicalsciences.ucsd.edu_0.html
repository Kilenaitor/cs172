<h2><a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/sdsc_shares_hpcwires_top_supercomputing_achievement_awards1"><strong>Physics Professor Shares ‘Two Supercomputing Achievement’ Awards</strong></a></h2>
<p>An organization headed by UC San Diego physics professor Frank Würthwein recently received two HPCwire ‘Top Supercomputing Achievement’ awards for 2016, recognizing the use of high performance computing to verify Einstein’s theory of gravitational waves.</p>
<p>Würthwein, the current executive director of the Open Science Grid, worked in tandem with researchers to make these resources available to scientists working on the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory  over the course of several months to verify the statistical significance of the observed gravitational wave, thus leading to its unambiguous detection.</p>
<p>Würthwein is also the San Diego Supercomputer Center’s head of High Throughput Computing.</p>
<p>Funded by the U.S. Department of Energy and National Science Foundation, the Open Science Grid is a multi-disciplinary research partnership specializing in high throughput computational services.</p>
<p>The HPCwire awards were presented at the 2016 International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis (SC16), in Salt Lake City, Utah. The Open Science Grid won in both the online publication’s annual Readers’ Choice and Editors’ Choice categories.

<p>Ruth Williams, a mathematician who analyzes math models associated with real-life problems, came to UC San Diego in 1983, attracted to the La Jolla campus by the strong science, engineering and mathematics faculty that she believed she could collaborate with to develop new theories and models in her field.</p>
<p>“I thought this was the place for me because I was, and am, still very motivated by applications,” said the professor of mathematics, who over the past three decades has developed fruitful collaborations with faculty on the campus in biology, cognitive science, electrical engineering and mechanical and aerospace engineering.</p>
<p>It was, in many ways, a prescient decision. As many academic disciplines have become more quantitative and data-driven, mathematical modeling and—especially her research on modeling “stochastic networks” to streamline the functioning of the congested Internet, sophisticated manufacturing systems and transportation networks running at capacity—has become an essential means by which researchers have been able to solve difficult problems.</p>

<p class="dek"><span class="dc">G</span>raduate studies within any single scientific discipline are challenging endeavors on their own. But imagine combining graduate school-level training in physics and mathematics with advanced research in engineering and biology.</p>
<p>That’s the challenge of a new graduate program at UC San Diego that’s teaching Ph.D. students how to combine the power of physics and math-based reasoning with practical engineering skills and biology in an effort to unravel the fundamental principles of living systems—principles that will likely encompass concepts reaching well beyond those of traditional biology.</p>
<p>The goal of this ambitious program is to develop a new generation of scientists who are simultaneously fluent in biology, physics, mathematics and engineering. The program aims to train scientists who can not only develop instruments capable of quantifying the behaviors of living organisms but also develop and experimentally test their own theories based on these data. These young scientists are to be the foundation of an emerging discipline known as “quantitative biology”—or “qBio.”</p>
<h2><strong>Nine Physical Sciences Graduate Students Awarded ARCS Foundation Fellowships</strong></h2>
<p>Nine graduate students in the Division of Physical Sciences have been awarded fellowships provided to exceptional students pursuing research in the natural sciences, engineering and medicine from the San Diego chapter of the ARCS Foundation, Inc.</p>
<p>A national nonprofit organization led entirely by women, the ARCS Foundation is dedicated to boosting American leadership in science and technology by supporting promising undergraduate and graduate students. Since its inception in 1985, the San Diego chapter has awarded nearly $5 million to graduate students at UC San Diego.</p>
<p>The nine Division of Physical Sciences students were among 34 UC San Diego graduate students who this year received a total of $255,000 in fellowship awards from the ARCS Foundation.</p>
<p>They include five graduate students in the Department of Physics, three in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and one in the Department of Mathematics.</p>
<p>The five physics graduate students are Frederick Matsuda, Emily Nardoni, David Leon and Aleksandra Shirman. The three chemistry graduate students are Michael Denny, Jr., Cassandra Callmann and Jessica Peters. The mathematics graduate student is Robert Snellman.</p>
<p>In addition to their financial awards, recognition as an ARCS Scholar gives students access to a network of talented researchers in academia and industry.</p>

<h2><strong>Kim Prather Named  One of 'Top 50 Women in Analytical Science'</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="prather" height="226" src="_images/Prather.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" width="444"/>Kim Prather has been named one of the “top 50 women in  analytical science” by the <em>Analytical Science</em> magazine, which recently published its first ever all-women Power List, featuring “50 talented scientists who brilliantly represent the scope and impact of the analytical sciences.”</p>
<p>“As always, we don’t proclaim that our Power List is definitive – influence is subjective,” said Rich Whitworth, editor of the magazine. “But given its future-facing focus, we do hope it’s predictive.”</p>
<p>Prather, who holds the Distinguished Chair in Atmospheric Chemistry and is Director of the Center for Aerosol Impacts on Climate and the Environment, is a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry and at Scripps Institution of Oceanography.</p>
<p>Nominations for the Analytical Scientist Power List were openly requested and reviewed by an expert judging panel consisting of well-respected scientists and the magazine’s editorial team to produce the final list of 50 women, which can be found online at <a href="https://theanalyticalscientist.com/power-list/2016/">https://theanalyticalscientist.com/power-list/2016/</a></p>
<p>Since it began publishing in 2013, the magazine has published two top 100 and a top 40 under 40 power list.</p>
<p>“Our Power Lists are intended to be a celebration of the whole analytical field – and our top 50 women list is no different in that respect; however, we do think it’s important for The Analytical Scientist to step up and highlight positive role models for young female scientists,” said Whitworth. “We also want to give the analytical community the opportunity to reflect on diversity and equality in general.”</p>

<h3>UC San Diego celebrates philanthropy at groundbreaking of new Biological and Physical Sciences Building</h3>
<p>As UC San Diego commemorated the groundbreaking of its new Biological and Physical Sciences Building this month, the campus also celebrated two gifts that will help shape the future of science, including $2 million in support from the Kavli Foundation and a legacy bequest from the Honorable Lynn A. Schenk.</p>
<p>The Biological and Physical Sciences Building is a much-needed facility constructed in response to the rapid growth of both the Division of Biological Sciences and the Division of Physical Sciences over the past 15 years. The new seven-story building, located near the Main Gym in the Revelle College area of campus, will provide 128,000 square feet of additional space for 20 research laboratories. Research inside the building will focus on brain activity mapping, advanced energy and drug discovery innovation.</p>
<h2>Neal Devaraj Receives $1.9 Million NIH Award for Diabetes Study </h2>
<p>Neal Devaraj, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry, has received $1.9 million from the National Institutes of Health to develop new imaging methods that will help the more than 1 million people in the United States living with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease that destroys the insulin-secreting beta cells of the pancreas.</p>
<p>Molecular imaging tools are needed to monitor the progression of type 1 diabetes, the effectiveness of treatment and to track the viability of transplanted cells. Devaraj and his team of researchers will develop imaging methods to measure beta cell numbers in the pancreas.</p>
<p>Developing a tool that can measure cells that compromise one to two percent of the pancreas has been challenging, said Devaraj. Using existing positron emission tomography (PET) technology, he plans to capitalize on enzymes to amplify signals that sensitize beta cells for improved imaging. Before the onset of disease, this information could inform physicians if a patient is at risk of developing type 1 diabetes.</p>
<p>“This is a new and exciting direction for our lab,” said Devaraj. “The development of methods that amplify PET signals could lead to valuable imaging tools for monitoring beta cell mass. It could have an enormous impact on the diagnosis, treatment and understanding of type 1 diabetes. Moreover, the same concept might enable us to image very small targets like tumors when they may be invisible by other means. This method has potential to be more broadly applied to other diseases.”</p>
<p>Devaraj’s award is part of  more than $5 million recently awarded by the NIH to UC San Diego researchers for type 1 diabetes research.

<h4>Doctoral student Cliff Kapono sets out on an adventure to map the surfer microbiome</h4>
<p><span>Surfers have a very intimate connection to the ocean. Their skin is bathed in the rushing tide, and crashing waves send salty seawater into their ears, eyes and throat. Inside and out, they are saturated with diverse molecules and bacteria to which the average person is not exposed. This prompts the question: How do these unique bacteria and chemicals impact human health? Cliff Kapono, UC San Diego chemistry doctoral student, is embarking on a worldwide quest to find out.</span></p>
<p><span><span>A native of the Big Island of Hawaii, Kapono is passionate about his heritage and promoting the well-being of people and our planet. As a scientist, he seeks to tap into the microscopic world of bacteria, fungi, viruses and other microbes. These microbiomes, or communities of microorganisms and their gene products, live in our bodies and on our skin and pervade much of the world around us. And scientists are just beginning to discover their impact on human and environmental health.</span></span></p>

<p><img alt="Haldane" height="300" src="_images/Haldane.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 10px;" width="200"/>F. Duncan Haldane, the Princeton University physicist who was awarded 2016 Nobel Prize in Physics this week for his research into the properties of matter in extreme states, was a professor of physics at UC San Diego from 1986 to 1992.</p>
<p>Haldane, who joined the Princeton faculty after he left the La Jolla campus, shared the Nobel Prize with David Thouless of the University of Washington and J. Michael Kosterlitz of Brown University “for theoretical discoveries of topological phase transitions and topological phases of matter.”</p>
<p>“They have used advanced mathematical methods to study unusual phases, or states, of matter, such as superconductors, superfluids or thin magnetic films,” the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said in announcing the award.</p>
<p>Haldane said in an interview publicized by Princeton University on the day he was informed of his Nobel Prize that “My work was a kind of sleeper. It was a very theoretical thing. ... It didn't become such a big deal until my work got extended” by other scientists.</p>
<p>On the nature of discovery, he added, “All these things are things that no one expects. You stumble over something and then you find the big picture after.”</p>
<h2>Elizabeth Villa Wins Prestigious NIH Grant </h2>
<img alt="Villa" height="299" src="_images/NIH_Villa.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" width="200"/>
<p>Elizabeth Villa<strong>,</strong> a biophysicist who is an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, received a $2.325 million New Innovator Award from the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>She was one of only 48 researchers nationwide this year to receive the prestigious award, which was established in 2007 and is designed to support unusually innovative research from early career investigators who are within 10 years of their final degree or clinical residency and have not yet received a research project grant or equivalent NIH grant.</p>
<p>Villa, who will use her award for her research project on “Opening Windows into the Cell: Revealing the Molecular Architecture of the Nuclear Periphery,” received her Ph.D. in Biophysics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign working with Klaus Schulten on multiscale simulations of biomolecular complexes, where she worked closely with Joachim Frank developing computational tools for cryo-electron microscopy.</p>
<p>She was a Marie Curie postdoctoral fellow in the lab of Wolfgang Baumeister at the Max Planck Institute of Biochemistry in Munich. Her lab develops tools to observe macromolecular complexes in their natural environment, the cell. Her goal is to transform cryo-electron tomography into a high-resolution technique to unveil the structural dynamics of these complexes that is directly compatible with other biophysics experiments. She combines cell biology and cryo-electron microscopy to generate data, and use computational analysis and physical modeling to understand these data. Her current research is focused on studying the nuclear periphery, one of the most exciting and structurally uncharted territories in the cell.</p>

<p>Migratory birds often use warm, rising atmospheric currents to gain height with little energy expenditure when flying over long distances.</p>
<p>It’s a behavior known as thermal soaring that requires complex decision-making within the turbulent environment of a rising column of warm air from the sun baked surface of the earth. But exactly how birds navigate within this ever-changing environment to optimize their thermal soaring was unknown until a team of physicists and biologists at the University of California San Diego took an exacting computational look at the problem.</p>

<p>Biochemists at the University of California San Diego have developed artificial cell membranes that grow and remodel themselves in a manner similar to that of living mammalian cells.</p>
<p>The achievement, detailed in a paper published in this week’s issue of the <em>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</em> <a href="http://ucsdnews.ucsd.edu/pressrelease/scientists_create_synthetic_membranes_that_grow_like_living_cells">follows the successful design last yea</a>r in the same laboratory of artificial, or synthetic, cell membranes capable of sustaining continual growth. The two developments now bring the researchers closer to mimicking all of the properties of living mammalian cell membranes with synthetic components.</p>
<h2><strong>James McKernan Named Simons Investigator</strong></h2>
<p><img alt="Mckernan" height="259" src="_images/JamesMcKernan.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 10px;" width="220"/>Mathematics Professor James McKernan has been named by the Simons Foundation as a Simons Investigator, an honor that will provide him with an award of $100,000 per year in research support over the next five years.</p>
<p>In announcing his selection as a 2016 Simons Investigator, the foundation said that “McKernan, in collaboration with Caucher Birkar, Paolo Cascini, and Christopher D. Hacon, has established one of the cornerstones of the Minimal Model Program: the finite generation of canonical rings in all dimensions.”</p>
<p>McKernan, who received his doctorate in mathematics from Harvard University in 1991, was a professor at UC Santa Barbara and MIT before coming to UC San Diego and currently holds the Charles Lee Powell Endowed Chair in Mathematics.</p>
<p>His research is focused on birational geometry and his work has been recognized by professional organizations with numerous awards: the Clay Research Award in 2007 and the Cole Prize in Algebra in 2009.  In 2011, he was elected to the Royal Society in the UK. He was also honored by being invited to and delivering a lecture at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Hyderabad in 2010.</p>

<p>A team of physicists that visualized the internal nanostructure of an intact butterfly wing has discovered two physical attributes that make those structures so bright and colorful.</p>
<p>“Over millions of years, butterflies have evolved sophisticated cellular mechanisms to grow brightly colored structures, normally for the purpose of camouflage as well as mating,” says Oleg Shpyrko, an associate professor of physics at UC San Diego, who headed the research effort. “It’s been known for a century that the wings of these beautiful creatures contain what are called photonic crystals, which can reflect light of only a particular color.”</p>

<p>Scientists at UC San Diego, MIT and Harvard University have engineered “topological plexcitons,” energy-carrying particles that could help make possible the design of new kinds of solar cells and miniaturized optical circuitry.</p>
<p>The researchers report their advance in an article published in the current issue of <em>Nature Communications.</em></p>
<p>Within the Lilliputian world of solid state physics, light and matter interact in strange ways, exchanging energy back and forth between them.</p>
<p>“When light and matter interact, they exchange energy,” explained Joel Yuen-Zhou, an assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UC San Diego and the first author of the paper. “Energy can flow back and forth between light in a metal (so called plasmon) and light in a molecule (so called exciton). When this exchange is much faster than their respective decay rates, their individual identities are lost, and it is more accurate to think about them as hybrid particles; excitons and plasmons marry to form plexcitons.”</p>
